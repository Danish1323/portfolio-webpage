<h1>The best Movies According to Danish</h1>
<h2> My top 5 movies of all time are</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>It is probably the best Studio Ghibli movies ever, it has great animation and a strong story.</p>

<h3>Insidious</h3>
<p>This is a great horror movie with a lot of suspense and a good story.</p>

<h3>Dead Poets Society</h3>
<p>This is probably my all time favourite, this movie made an impact so strong that i was feeling the kind
    of emptiness that you feel after completing your favorite web series or tv show, the thing is this movie was 
    amazing no words can describe the love i have for this movie.
</p>

<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>I mean who doesnt love this movie.</p>

<h3>The Children of Men</h3>
<p>I think this is one of a kind but seriously good movie i had 0 expectations about what this movie is going
    to be as i have seen so many awful movies that are ranked pretty high but this movie is just mind blowing.
